          <strong>Self-Growth:</strong> The last two semesters with Interpreting skills classes and practicum have pushed me to new heights as a student interpreter. I look at my self-growth through these last two semesters and I can see how much I have learned and developed in my interpreting skills. I proved myself capable of things that I probably would never have tried to attempt before such as interpreting in a church stage setting with music and a large audience. I will never think about the English language in the same way ever again. I have so much more appreciation for interpreting as a skill than I did prior to beginning classes last Fall semester.

          <strong>Areas of Opportunity:</strong> I had no clue how difficult the road ahead would be in learning what true bilingualism is and how important it is for an interpreter to be a truly balanced bilingual. However, I am grateful for beginning this experience. I believe I am still at an early stage of this journey to becoming an interpreter. There are many areas of opportunity for me to develop my interpreting skills prior to me feeling ready to be able to take the next steps toward interpreter certification. A big area of opportunity that I hope to develop further is my lack of confidence and the presence of imposter syndrome. I often may hold onto my lack of success in my interpreting work, and I am hopeful that this will become less of an obstacle as I continue to develop my interpreting skills post-graduation. I am proud of myself for my growth in learning how to become an interpreter and I am eager to continue developing my skills further after the completion of my studies at Northern Essex Community College.

          <strong>Future Plans:</strong> I look forward to building upon my language skills in the years ahead. I aspire to find work within the Deaf community after graduation in May 2023. I will be looking for mentorship opportunities as well. In the future, I hope to complete my bachelorâ€™s degree in interpreting American Sign Language and English at the University of New Hampshire, Manchester.

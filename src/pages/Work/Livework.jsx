        stuff: `In Spring 2023 semester, my subject matter expert presentation on art painting featured an instructional lesson on how to paint a starry night scene. These presentations for Spring 2023 included roleplaying for the class. Two students took on the role of team interpreters, and three other students had headphones on with white noise to only rely on the interpretation. These unique roleplaying experience features for these presentations added some new dynamic challenges.
        `,
        stuff2: `I reflected on the knowledge that I gained from the previous presentation while planning out the details and execution for a live instructional painting lesson. I had to pay close attention to how long each section of the painting would take and I wanted to improve upon my engagement with the audience. I simplified the length of written text that I needed to present this time around. The only text that I required for the presentation I had featured on my PowerPoint and on one small piece of paper.
        `,
        stuff3: `I set a goal to challenge myself further with this presentation by selecting Vincent van Gogh’s The Starry Night for the painting I would depict with only classifiers and colors in American Sign Language. This painting was much more difficult to render, and I felt I was successful in my execution of a depiction for it.
        `,
        stuff4: `I felt more confident in this presentation and in teaching participants how to paint a starry night scene. I even remembered to breathe more during my presentation, and I reminded myself to be mindful not to speak too fast. Each participant was able to paint a starry night scene and keep their painting as a souvenir.

        stuff: `In Fall 2022 semester, I presented a subject matter expert presentation on art painting. It had been well over ten years since I was placed in a similar experience as a speaker to an audience. Though, art painting proved to be an excellent subject matter to present because of my previous background in studying art painting.
        `,
        stuff2: `Despite my comfort in the subject matter, I still felt very nervous to be the presenter for an audience of new classmates. I hid my face in my papers at times during this presentation and I spoke way too fast. My typed document for this presentation was over twelve pages long. Which was way too long for this presentation.
        `,
        stuff3: `I learned more about depiction in this assignment and I appreciated the challenges I faced in creating a depiction of a painting with only classifiers and colors. The key terms list, definitions, synonyms, idioms, and quiz questions that I used for this assignment were also valuable in planning out a foundation for the following subject matter expert presentation.

        stuff2: `The purpose of the setting of the song was for Sunday church worship services and the terminology used for this setting included specialized terminology relating to Christian religion. These environmental demands for the setting and terminology were managed with pre-assignment controls including preparation with the scripture, sermon, practice, and review of my gloss of the song lyrics. Another pre-assignment control I employed was to use the process of self-assessment of my previous experience interpreting this song by reviewing a recording of the first time I had interpreted “I Speak Jesus’ at church.
        `,
        stuff3: `The interpersonal demands of the emotional tone and mood were present. Services can be emotional and personal due to the nature of worship. There are times audience members walk to the side of the stage to kneel and pray. At my sight at the stage, you can see the audience express deep emotions, crying or praying, or singing or signing along with the music. This experience can feel emotionally touching or even overwhelming. During the assignment, I manage this demand by trying my best to remember to focus on my breathing while interpreting. A post-assignment control I employ is to journal about the experience as a form of self-care.

        h3: `Ethical action and decision-making reflection post interpretation:`,
        stuff4: `In this service at church, the pastor started speaking a little before the song and this was not planned or practiced during rehearsal. The interpreter team will switch out in-between songs and usually, the band transitions right into the next song and the pastor doesn’t usually speak right before the song. At this moment, an intrapersonal demand was triggered for me. I started to experience some anxiety with this as I was caught off guard. During the assignment control I employed was to look over to my mentor who started to support me by assisting with providing a feed for the interpretation. If I decided to omit this part of the interpretation, I believe that would be an example of inaction. I would categorize this on the conservative side of the scale on ethical and effective decisions and actions. The decision made in this experience to continue to provide the interpretation of the message at that moment to the best of my ability with my mentor’s support with feeding; I would consider this a correct action on the scale of ethical and effective decisions and actions.

        h4: `Reflection regarding this interpretation: 
        `,
        stuff5: `Reflecting on my experience interpreting the song "I Speak Jesus" live, I felt that this was one of my most successful song interpretations. This was the second time I had interpreted this same song during my practicum at the church and I decided to keep the same signs for this song. This was a good decision as this assisted me with feeling more comfortable with the signs I had chosen to use for this interpretation. Compared to my first experience of interpreting this song, I could breathe more, smile more, and be a little less fidgety with my legs. I felt that my interpretation was able to convey the meaning and emotion of the song. My depictions, role-shifting, and non-manual markers throughout were rendered well. I recognize there is still room for improvement in enhancing the clarity of my sign production and adjusting when certain signs stop or start with transitions of song pacing.

    stuff: `Using the DC-S framework, I contemplated further on my experience as the interpreter assigned to interpret “Fresh Wind” and I have identified some demands and controls that I employed to manage them.
    `,
    stuff2: `The environmental demands included the purpose of the setting of the song for Sunday church worship services and the terminology used for this setting included specialized terminology relating to Christian religion. I managed these demands with pre-assignment controls including preparation with the scripture, sermon, research into the lyrics, and the intended meaning relating to spiritual content. I also met with my mentor prior to services to receive feedback on the gloss I created while practicing the interpretation.

    stuff3: `The interpersonal demands of the intensity of emotional tone and mood are often present during services. Services can be emotional and personal due to the nature of worship.

    h3: `Ethical action and decision-making reflection post interpretation:`,
    stuff4: `In this live interpretation of the song “Fresh Wind,” I made an error in which verse was next and froze up in my interpretation. I did not make it clear to the Deaf clients present of my interpreter error at that moment as I proceeded to catch up to the correct verse section of the song. In this part of the interpretation, I had acted more conservatively on the scale of ethical and effective decisions and actions. However, post-services I had received some feedback from a Deaf church member and had informed them of my mistake. They were aware that I am a student interpreter and were encouraging in their feedback to me about making mistakes during interpretations.
    `,
    h4: `Reflection regarding this interpretation: 
    `,
    stuff5: `When I reflect on my experience interpreting the song “Fresh Wind,” I feel proud of the choices I made for depiction, the use of space, and cultural mediation. The song has a line about “hearing the wind blowing” and I used “seeing the wind blowing” to provide a better cultural match. I appreciated how this song created many opportunities to provide a depiction of the many elements in the song. The fire, wind, breathing, and pouring depictions were some of my favorite parts of the song to express. An area for improvement would be to correct any sections where there is a mistake in sign production. Toward the end of the song, “wind” has an incorrect palm orientation.

    stuff: `By applying the DCS framework, I was able to properly prepare for this assignment, and post-assignment I benefitted from analyzing my experience as the interpreter.
    `,
    stuff2: `The environmental demands of specialized religious terminology and the goal of the scripture’s message were managed with pre-assignment controls of preparation. My preparation for this was extensive including researching the scripture, discussing the scripture with the pastors a week prior, and reviewing and researching how scripture verses are interpreted by Deaf people and interpreters. A post-assignment control was to review with my mentor what was missed or could be improved upon for scripture interpreting.
    `,
    stuff3: `The paralinguistic demand for fast-paced speech is handled by making an adjustment in the interpretation. Corinthians was abbreviated to COR in fingerspelling. This is accepted as an official abbreviation for this bible. However, I can recognize that depending on the Deaf church members, they may prefer the full title spelled. I made this control decision due to my current level of skill with fingerspelling. In previous practice runs, I was falling too far behind in my interpretation with how slow my pace is currently with fingerspelling. A post-assignment control is to continue to practice my fingerspelling of these long titles to improve my fingerspelling pace and production.
    `,
    h3: `Ethical action and decision-making reflection post interpretation:`,
    stuff4: `Live services presents a challenge in how an interpreter may handle an error made in their interpretation. When scripture is read live, it is a short amount of time that lapses before the pastors begin to preach their sermons. A control that most interpreters would suggest employing would be to inform the pastors that they are catching up in their interpretation. Unfortunately, sometimes this is not possible to request. Services have a specific arrangement of what will occur next within a planned amount of time. The services are formal and frozen registers. In my sample, I did not note an error in forgetting a negation that would impact the meaning of the scripture in that line. I acted on the conservative side of the scale of ethical and effective decisions and actions. Fortunately, post-assignment from services presents an opportunity to discuss with Deaf church members an error, or omissions, or to clarify parts of their interpretation.
    `,
    h4: `Reflection regarding this interpretation: 
    `,
    stuff5: `This internship sample video of my interpretation of the scripture verses 4 through 7 from Chapter 13 book 1 Corinthians shows me how much I have grown this semester. (1 Corinthians 13: 4-7 NIV)
    My depiction, use of space, non-manual markers, and role-shifting features seem accurate and clear throughout this interpretation. During my preparation for this interpretation, I heavily researched the meaning of this scripture and reviewed videos that I found of Deaf individuals interpreting scripture. This was helpful in providing me with a deeper understanding of the content and ideas for how I could approach this interpretation. I created a gloss of the signs I intended to use, and I practiced my interpretation on Zoom with my mentor interpreter.  My mentor provided feedback and was supportive in providing helpful tips for adjustments I could make to improve my interpretation. There is room for improvement where I forgot to include a negation sign after the listing of remembering mistakes. My eye gaze could also be improved in certain sections where I am looking down at my gloss to not forget the next verse.
